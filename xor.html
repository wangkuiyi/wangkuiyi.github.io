an MLP Using Your Brain Rather Than a GPU to Address the XOR
Classification Challenge</h1>
<p>This exercise is a great way to understand why activation functions
are essential in neural networks.</p>
<p>Imagine being asked about this in a job interview. You’re expected to
provide an example of a classification problem that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cannot be solved using a linear classifier,</li>
<li>Can be addressed using a multilayer perceptron (MLP),</li>
<li>Requires an activation function.</li>
</ol>
<p>A classic example is the XOR challenge. Surprisingly, when searching
for solutions online, several sources <a

<a
href="https://dataqoil.com/2022/06/24/multilayer-percepron-using-xor-function-from/">3</a>
claim that the backpropagation algorithm can estimate the parameters of
an MLP that solves the challenge but fail to provide the estimated
parameters. Others <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37734655/neural-network-solving-xor">4</a>
suggest that an MLP should mimic the logical equation
<code>x1 XOR x2 == NOT (x1 AND x2) AND (x1 OR x2)</code>, but they do
not explain how. A few even present incorrect parameters. This inspired
me to attempt solving the XOR challenge manually.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-linearly-classifiable">What Does It Mean
to Be Linearly Classifiable?</h2>
<p>Consider some points on a 2D plane, each colored either blue or red.
The points are linearly classifiable if you can draw a straight line
such that all red points lie on one side and all blue points on the
other.</p>
<p>For programmers, this definition makes sense because it’s computable.
Given the coordinates and colors of points, a linear regression model
estimated using error backpropagation can determine where this line
should be.</p>
<p>For example, if all red points have a y-coordinate greater than 10,
and all blue points have y-values less than 10, the line <span
class="math inline">\(y = 10\)</span> perfectly separates them by
color.</p>
<h2 id="the-xor-challenge-not-linearly-classifiable">The XOR Challenge:
Not Linearly Classifiable</h2>
<p>In the XOR challenge, there are four points with the following
coordinates and colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>(0,0) - red</li>
<li>(0,1) - blue</li>
<li>(1,0) - blue</li>
<li>(1,1) - red</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to imagine a line that separates these points by color—it’s
impossible! No matter how you rotate the line, you can’t divide the
points by their colors. This is a non-linearly separable problem.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-the-xor-problem-into-an-easier-form">Transforming
the XOR Problem into an Easier Form</h2>
<p>While imagining this, you may realize that if we could somehow
transform the point (0,1) closer to (1,0), or move (1,1) near (0,0), the
points would become linearly classifiable.</p>
<p>One straightforward way to achieve this is through a linear
transformation, defined by a matrix <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and a bias vector <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W = \begin{bmatrix} w_{11} &amp; w_{12} \\ w_{21} &amp; w_{22}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Applying this transformation to a point <span
class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> gives the new coordinates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(x, y) \rightarrow (w_{11}x + w_{12}y + v_1, w_{21}x + w_{22}y + v_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>We aim to estimate these parameters without backpropagation, starting
with simple guesses.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with both <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> set to zero. This would fuse all
points to <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span>, which doesn’t
help. If <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is diagonally identical
and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is zero, no point moves, so
the problem remains unsolved.</p>
<p>Now, let’s assume that all entries in <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are ones. This gives the
transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(x, y) \rightarrow (x + y + v_1, x + y + v_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>For the XOR challenge, this transformation produces:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(0,0) \rightarrow (v_1, v_2)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(0,1) \rightarrow (1 + v_1, 1 + v_2)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(1,0) \rightarrow (1 + v_1, 1 + v_2)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(1,1) \rightarrow (2 + v_1, 2 + v_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the middle two blue points now coincide. This is
progress! However, this setup still doesn’t linearly separate the
points, as all of them are now on the same line. This is where
activation functions come in to introduce non-linearity.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-need-activation-functions">Why We Need Activation
Functions</h2>
<p>Activation functions like softmax, tanh, and ReLU clamp negative
inputs to 0 (or a close value). The key idea is to “clamp” points in a
way that separates them.</p>
<p>Given the transformed points:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(v_1, v_2), \quad (1 + v_1, 1 + v_2), \quad (2 + v_1, 2 + v_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>We can choose <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> such that the activation function
clamps one point entirely, partially clamps another, and leaves the
third unchanged, thus breaking their alignment on the same line.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = v_2\)</span>.
Unfortunately, this keeps the points on a line parallel to <span
class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span>. To achieve our goal, <span
class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> must be negative but different. If
the absolute values of <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> are less than 2, the third
point remains unclamped, while the first point gets clamped to <span
class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span>. We aim for one coordinate of the
second point to be clamped while the other remains positive, which leads
to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
v_1 = -0.5, \quad v_2 = -1.5
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="now-we-can-linearly-classify">Now, We Can Linearly
Classify!</h2>
<p>After the linear transformation and activation, the four points
transform as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(0,0) \rightarrow \sigma(v_1, v_2) = (0,0)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(0,1) \rightarrow \sigma(1 + v_1, 1 + v_2) = (0.5, 0)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(1,0) \rightarrow \sigma(1 + v_1, 1 + v_2) = (0.5, 0)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
(1,1) \rightarrow \sigma(2 + v_1, 2 + v_2) = (1.5, 0.5)
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, you can easily draw a line separating the red points from the
blue points:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = \frac{0.5}{1.5}x - 0.001 \approx \frac{1}{3}x - 0.001
\]</span></p>
<p>The slope is derived from the third point, as the first two are on
the x-axis. The intercept <span class="math inline">\(-0.001\)</span> is
a small negative value to ensure proper separation.</p>
<h2 id="the-mlp-for-solving-xor">The MLP for Solving XOR</h2>
<p>An MLP is defined by the following equations. Given a point <span
class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span>, the MLP computes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s = \sigma(v_1 h_1 + v_2 h_2 + c)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
h_1 = \sigma(w_{11}x + w_{12}y + b_1)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
h_2 = \sigma(w_{21}x + w_{22}y + b_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>From the above derivation, we can estimate the parameters needed to
solve the XOR classification:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s = \sigma(3 h_1 + h_2 - 0.001)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
h_1 = \sigma(x + y - 0.5)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
h_2 = \sigma(x + y - 1.5)
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(s &gt; 0\)</span>, classify <span
class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> as red; otherwise, classify it as
blue.</p>
<p>This concludes the mental exercise of manually solving the XOR
problem using an MLP.</p>
